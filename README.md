"#Star-Wars-Weather" 

Star Wars flavored weather application! Mmmm, tasty.

Pulls and displays user's current location and temperature, defaulting to Fahrenheit.
User has the ability to switch between F and C and input any city they like. The corresponding weather will be represented by the respective Star Wars planet.

To Do:
Address responsiveness for smaller screens.
Add input validation to "change location" button.
Refactor JS code for more DRY.
Add "conditions" read out, which displays current weather conditions.
Add more planets and backgrounds based on additional temperatures and conditions.
