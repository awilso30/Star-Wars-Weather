"#Star-Wars-Weather" 

Star Wars flavored weather application! Mmmm, tasty.

Pulls and displays user's current location and temperature, defaulting to Fahrenheit.
User has the ability to switch between F and C and input any city they like. The corresponding weather will be represented by the respective Star Wars planet.

To Do:<br>
Increase responsiveness for smaller screens.<br>
Add input validation and error handling to "change location" button.<br>
Refactor JS code for more DRY.<br>
Add "conditions" read out, which displays current weather conditions.<br>
Add more planets and backgrounds based on additional temperatures and conditions.<br>
